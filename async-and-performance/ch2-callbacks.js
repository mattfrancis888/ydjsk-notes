//Async and wait => promises => callbacks
//Kyle states the problem of callbacks : Callback hell, Gracefully Handling callback errors, \
//mistrust in utilizing the callback (sometimes an API method can cause unexpected callback errors) like:

/* Call the callback too early
Call the callback too late (or never)
Call the callback too few or too many times
Fail to pass along any necessary environment/parameters
Swallow any errors/exceptions that may happen */
